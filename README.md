This table estimates how much **Real Analysis** and **Group Theory** contribute to each of the **seven Millennium Prize Problems**.

| Millennium Problem                               | 🧮 Real Analysis % | ♾️ Group Theory % | 💡 Explanation                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. **Riemann Hypothesis**                        | 20%                | 80%               | Analytic function theory involved, but deep roots in Galois groups, modular symmetries.       |
| 2. **P vs NP**                                   | 5%                 | 0%                | Mostly logic and computational complexity theory; barely touches analysis or groups.          |
| 3. **Navier–Stokes Existence & Smoothness**      | 95%                | 5%                | Dominated by PDEs, smooth functions, Sobolev spaces – a pure real analysis challenge.         |
| 4. **Yang–Mills Existence & Mass Gap**           | 60%                | 40%               | Uses Hilbert space theory (analysis) and symmetry/gauge theory via Lie groups (group theory). |
| 5. **Hodge Conjecture**                          | 40%                | 60%               | Analysis for differential forms; group cohomology in topology and algebraic geometry.         |
| 6. **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture**      | 30%                | 70%               | Elliptic curves, L-functions, and deep group-theoretic structure (Galois, arithmetic groups).  |
| 7. **Poincaré Conjecture (solved)**              | 60%                | 40%               | Solved using Ricci flow (analysis), with topology based on the fundamental group.             |

Real analysis plays a foundational role in topology and group theory, particularly when those fields interact with geometry, functional analysis, or Lie theory. Let’s break this into parts:
🔹 Real Analysis in Topology
1. Metric Spaces (Real Analysis → Topology)

    Real analysis studies convergence and continuity using ε-δ definitions. These lead naturally to:

        Metric spaces: A set with a distance function d(x, y) satisfying:

            Positivity, symmetry, triangle inequality

        Real analysis defines open sets, convergent sequences, continuity, etc., in ℝⁿ. Topology generalizes these using open sets.

👉 Used to define:

    Topological spaces

    Continuous functions

    Compactness and connectedness (generalized from ℝ)

2. Compactness & Convergence

    In real analysis:

        A closed interval [a, b] is compact (Heine-Borel Theorem).

        A sequence converges iff it's Cauchy (in complete metric spaces).

    In topology:

        Compactness is defined via open covers.

        Sequential compactness leads to limit point topology, first-countability, etc.

👉 Real analysis tools help build intuition and proofs about:

    Compactness

    Limits

    Continuity in abstract topological spaces

3. Connectedness

    ℝ is connected because there are no nontrivial clopen sets.

    Real analysis gives examples like intermediate value theorem.
